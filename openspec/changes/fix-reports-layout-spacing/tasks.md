## 1. Implementation
- [ ] 1.1 Move the Reports summary cards into a horizontally scrollable LazyRow that preserves existing card styling and spacing.
- [ ] 1.2 Update the Reports earnings chart drawing logic to reserve a label band so bars never overlap their month labels, keeping accessibility semantics intact.

## 2. Testing
- [ ] 2.1 Run `./gradlew connectedDebugAndroidTest` and verify all tests pass.
