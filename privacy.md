## Collecting and Using Your Personal Data

### Types of Data Collected

**Data Stored Locally on Your Device:**
Kora is designed to be privacy-first. All the data you enter into the application, including student names, lesson details, schedules, notes, and homework information, is stored exclusively on your local device. We do not have access to this data, and it is not automatically synced to any cloud server. You are in full control of your data.

**Data Shared with Third-Party Services:**
To provide the AI-powered insights feature, we share a limited and specific subset of your data with the Google Gemini API. The data shared includes:

*   Student's full name
*   Details of the last 10 historical lessons (date, status, duration, notes)
*   Details of the next 10 upcoming lessons
*   Details of the last 10 homework assignments (title, description, status, notes)

This data is sent solely for the purpose of generating personalized educational insights and recommendations for you within the application. We do not share payment information, fees, or pricing details with this service. The use of data by Google is subject to Google's own Privacy Policy.

### Use of Your Personal Data

We use the data solely for the following purposes:

*   **To provide and maintain our Service,** including its core functionalities of student and lesson management.
*   **To provide You with AI-powered insights,** which is a key feature of the Service.

### Your Data Rights and Management

You have complete control over your data within Kora:

*   **Data Export:** You can export all your data at any time using the "Export Backup (CSV)" feature.
*   **Data Deletion:** You can delete all your data permanently from your device using the "Reset All Data" feature. As the data is stored locally, this action is irreversible and completely removes your information.

## Security of Your Personal Data

The security of your data is important to us. Since all data is stored locally on your device, the security of that data is directly related to the security of your device itself. We recommend you use standard security practices, such as setting a passcode on your device.

## Children's Privacy

Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13.

## Links to Other Websites

Our Service may contain links to other websites that are not operated by Us (for example, this Privacy Policy itself). If You click on a third-party link, You will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise You to review the Privacy Policy of every site You visit.

We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may update Our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify You of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.

You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
